# ðŸš€ Appwrite-Starter
This initializer allows you to start creating projects with [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) faster.
The aim of this project is to provide templates, that already contain a working Appwrite setup.

## Get started
To get started just run the following command and follow the prompts.
```bash
npm init appwrite@latest
```
After that you just have to install the dependencies using
````bash
npm install
````
And finally to start the development server use
````bash
npm run dev
````

## Templates
Each framework is offered in a bare bones and batteries-included setup.
- Vue.JS
- Vanilla JS

Not seeing your favorite framework? Add it to the [repo](https://github.com/rdmchr/Appwrite-Starter) now!

## Technologies used
Each template is build upon [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) to provide fast hot reloads and other nice to have features.
They also each include Appwrite of course, but other than that each framework has a different template using different dependencies.
